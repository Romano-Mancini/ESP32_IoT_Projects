# IoT Projects with ESP32

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning and experimenting with IoT projects using ESP32 boards! This repository contains a variety of projects designed to deepen my understanding of IoT development, including sensor integration, wireless communication, and data processing. Each project serves as a hands-on experiment and learning exercise, progressively increasing in complexity as I acquire more knowledge.

## Exploration and Collaboration

Feel free to explore the code and hardware setups provided. While these projects primarily serve my learning journey, I encourage you to draw inspiration or propose enhancements if you find them beneficial.
